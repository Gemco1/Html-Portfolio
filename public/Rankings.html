<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Huge Batman Fan over here so it's only natural to pick the best of the trilogy as no. 1</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Tarantino's best work to date in my opinion.</p>
<h3>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World</h3>
<p>watched this one over a 100 times has that authentic comic booky feel to it.</p>
